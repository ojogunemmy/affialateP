                         <p> I had just lost my entire life savings on a Ponzi scheme that crashed (you remember racksterli)</p>
                         <p>So, I decided I was going to find a legitimate business online that was going to take care of my needs as a student…</p>
                         <p> One day, I was scrolling on twitter aimlessly when I saw a post where a <span class="span_bold">"Caleb Nwanneka"</span>  said he made 750k in one week from Affiliate Marketing.
                        </p>
                         <p> I said to myself "Is this one another Ponzi again?"</p>
                         <p>But then, I went through the entire thread and saw other people's testimonials as well…
                        </p>
                         <p>  Young people like me were making as much as 50k,100k, 250k, and even N500,000..</p>
                         <p>That was when  <span class="span_bold"> i decided I was going to start this business…</span></p>
                         <p>So, I ran around for the money, and it took me three weeks to gather the money I needed to start…</p>
                         <p> <span class="span_bold">I got the 72IG course,</span> <span class="span_under">studied it like mad</span> and started implementing...</p>
                         <p> One week passed - No sale.
                        </p>
                        <p>  Two weeks passed - No sale.</p>
                        <p>Three weeks passed - Nothing</p>
                        <p>Fourth week - I made a sale of a product that cost N5000.</p>
                        <p><span class="span_bold">Ahhh.</span> </p>
                        <p>I was getting frustrated. <span class="span_bold">This wasn't what I expected.</span></p>
                         <p>I thought by now, I would have made millions like I was promised when I wanted to sign up...</p>   
                           <p>While others were posting their alerts…</p> 
                           <p> I  <span class=" span_bold span_under">had only N2500 to show for 6 weeks</span> of hard work.</p>
                           <p>I was almost at the point of quitting everything…</p>
                            <p>...when I <span class="span_under">stumbled on a crazy sales system </span> that could potentially turn my fate around…</p>
                               <p> It was a training by Bruno Nwogu where he explained how to <span class="span_bold">make a lot of money with Affiliate marketing</span>  without even <span class="span_under">spending one kobo on ads…</span> </p>
                            <p>I even had to borrow money to attend the training back then.</p>
                            <p>After several hours of hard work and sleepless nights,<span class="span_bold"> I eventually cracked the code</span> and made my first N90k in one week!</p>
